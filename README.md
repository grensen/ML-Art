Some stuff around my ML work

## The Neural Network

## Visualising Data

60.000 dots in 10 colors, a trivial message behind the graph or my first try to visualize the entire MNIST dataset
For the effects the Intel fast_rand() function comes in:

The first reaction from my girl friend was "this looks like tv noise in colored", and I was happy. :-)

## The Parity Patterns

The parity patterns I've meet early 2019, quite interesting

A google seaarch after that art of patterns was not succesful

A dropout pattern seems like a way to use these patterns
