Some stuff around my ML work

## The Neural Network

## The Math behind

The deep Relationship between Machine Learning and e = (1+(1/N))^N. 
If I try to think about e, I imagine it as a spectrum of grey colors.

A full explanation of why ln () and exp () are so important would fill entire books. But with a basic understanding its clear to me how wonderful this visual expression is.

## Visualising Data

60.000 dots in 10 colors, a trivial message behind the graph or my first try to visualize the entire MNIST dataset
For the effects the Intel fast_rand() function comes in:

The first reaction from my girl friend was "this looks like tv noise in colored", and I was happy. :-)

## Reinforcement Learning with Q-Learning

With a Maze

Credits for this idea goes to [Dr. James D. McCaffrey](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2018/august/test-run-introduction-to-q-learning-using-csharp)

The Algorithm here based on his code.

Did you solved the maze? My agent did. :-)

Really good fun!

## The Parity Patterns

</p>

The parity patterns I've meet early 2019, quite interesting

</p>

A google seaarch after that art of patterns was not succesful

<p align="center">

</p>

A dropout pattern seems like a way to use these patterns
